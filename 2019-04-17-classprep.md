Something fascinating about *Station Eleven* is that the characters most central to the narrative are two characters introduced early, the first of whom is introduced as a child who seems to be fairly unimportant to the story, but then is followed through the narrative, the second of whom comes across as a classic leading character, but dies within the first ten pages. Yet, Arthur is central to the narrative, even after the reader knows he has passed away. Jeevan, on the other hand, who begins as an importanty character, truly becomes forgotten after the first of the sections that we read for class. Why the decision to throw off the reader with who is important and central to the narrative? Is it to mimic the way in real life things that seem important are not, and vice versa?
