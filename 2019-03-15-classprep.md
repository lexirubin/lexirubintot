I love online bots. Some of my favorite blogs on tumblr (I am loathe to admit that I still use that website, but I do) are bots that take two random things and smash them together; I love the absurd humor that results. A bot that detects accidental haikus? The height of comedy. Of all the twitter bots we looked at for classprep, Pentametron caught my eye. The combination of old (the sonnet form) and new (the tweets used), and the fact that this bot has had more success with NaNo-related events than I have, was wonderfully comical. But in contrast with Weingart's "The Route of a Text Message," the lack of heart in the bot is apparent, despite the same medium of words on a screen. All the words are written by humans; it's just the ordering that makes a change. Will bots eventually be able to write poems on the same emotinoal level as a simple text saying "I love you"? Why does who (or what) wrote something make such a huge difference in the way it's interpreted?
