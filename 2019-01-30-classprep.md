The shock that the historians seemed to have for Sequoyah and his knowledge of the English language seems to play into what is a very Westernized idea of knowledge. Ella Cushman says "Outsiders could only conceive of this writing system in their terms, terms that related it to their writing system," referring to the attitude that can be seen clearly in the 1995 Disney film, *Pocahontas*: "You think the only people who are people are the people who look and think like you." Why is this such a pervasive attitude in Western culture, especially given that the United States of America is a country made up entirely of things borrowed and stolen from other cultures? 
According to Cushman, the Cherokee people are faced with a choice of preserving their own culture to prevent it form dying out entirely, which forces them, in some ways, to halt the tracking of the growth of their people, or to perservere. Many are choosing to perservere, but why has it reached a point where it's an "either/or" scenario? Why has American culture so oppressed people to the point where they have to make an active effort to keep their own culture and language alive? The very manner of languages in this country is in its own rite hypocritical; you are encouraged to speak as many languages as possible, so you can put it down on paper, not so you can communicate with people.
