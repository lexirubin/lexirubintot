Working with the press gave me a new insight into just how much work went into printing “back in the day.” Obviously, the printing press made it easier to mass produce newspapers and the like, but it was still significantly more difficult than today’s printing methods. It makes sense, then, that even with that technology, things were not printed in nearly as generous quantities as they are now, and the cost of printing was likely much higher than it is now. However, despite the ease created by modern printing, I have to wonder if the payoff is still the same; to me, printing even just a small postcard on the letterpress was exciting enough that I hung it on my wall, which I have never even considered doing with something printed on a laser printer. Perhaps it was just the novelty of it, but I cannot help but think it was the *work* that went into it; the satisfaction of having set the type, of having been a part of the physical creation of the work itself, even the slight indentation in the paper from the type, allowed for a feeling of accomplishment. It is no wonder, then, that it was a profession in the capacity it had been, and no wonder that it has fallen out of practice as a well-known profession with modern-day technology. This does raise a question written about in many a science fiction story; how far should technology be allowed to progress? Does it reach a point where humanity as a whole begins to lose certain aspects of itself is technology is allowed to continue unchecked? What other mediums and arts are going to be lost to technology and preserved primarily in museums and universities?
I am not a particularly large person, and not necessarily as a direct result, but in the same vein, I am not particularly strong in a physical sense; I was incredibly caught off guard by how heavy the form was when it was ready to print, and by how much power it took to operate the letterpress. It was, beyond a doubt, a laborious task.  As a result, I was especially shocked to find out in the readings how frequently women worked in the press, because, to me, it seems like something that would have been considered “man’s work,” and women would have been barred from participating, given the manual labor aspect. What was it about the printing press that set it apart from other laborious jobs that women were not allowed to perform? On one hand, perhaps the humanities aspect made it less “intellectual” and more “feminine,” but back then, humanities was not nearly as strongly associated with women, because it was an academic field, and women were often barred from entering fields of the sort. Was it just that they needed more people to operate the press, or was it that maybe the people who worked in presses simply tended to be more open-minded?
