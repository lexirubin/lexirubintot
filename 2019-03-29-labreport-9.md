I wonder what Jane Austen-- or any author, for that matter-- would think of their work being reduced to numbers about words. In many ways, I feel like it might be a study in futility to look at books as numbers, because books are all about the message conveyed. That said, the manner in which a message is conveyed does carry a certain amount of weight regarding the meaning, and now that books are digitized, they really are no more than strings of 1’s and 0’s. Books have always been a form of data, because (in my opinion), data is any kind of information; but nothing should be reduced to data, and data alone. Data is wonderful for studying trends and patterns, and I think it could show, perhaps, unspoken truths about any work, such as which character the writer or writers deem to be the most important. For example, on the television series *Criminal Minds*, the character Aaron Hotchner is the one whose life receives the most focus; however, the character in the greatest number of episodes is Spencer Reid. Though Aaron may be more of a focal point for the writers, Spencer is the most important to the series as a whole. This kind of data could be used in books, especially ones with unreliable first-person narrators; though the narrator could express how important someone or something is to them on a frequent basis, this kind of data could show who or what the narrator talks about more than anything else, revealing the true most important person or thing. The problem with this use of data, of course, is this cannot be a hard and fast rule; in the award winning film *Silence of the Lambs*, Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter speaks fewer lines than any other character in the movie, in the Disney film *Sleeping Beauty*, the titular character has under twenty minutes of screen time, and in the Disney film *Dumbo*, the titular character does not speak a single word. At the same time, each of those three characters make their respective films a possibility. There is an irony, then, in relating this type of data to literature, because, especially in the case of authors such as Jane Austen, literature is used frequently to provide a platform for those who are stripped of their voices: animals, criminals, women, and many others. 

On the topic of women, many works written by women and other minorities were published anonymously, because their works would get more attention as literature from the public if people could assume they were written by white men; looking at the data of anonymous works could help determine specifics about the author based on syntax and vernacular, which means it is important in its own way.
