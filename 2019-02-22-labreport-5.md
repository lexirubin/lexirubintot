Unsurprisingly, before starting the printing press labs, I had no experience whatsoever with setting type. Going into it, I was concerned I would be too clumsy, or unfocused, or that I would just generally be very slow. Instead, I found it to be almost therapeutic. As Lynch points out, “typesetting is slow.” She mentions passing the time by chatting, which I found to be almost ironic, given her discussion of spaces and how their invention gave way to silent reading, and her discussion of how reading, beforehand, was almost a social activity. I think an interesting thing about this lab was the way that there was almost no immediate tangible completion. With other labs, such as the candlelight one, I was able to look down and see what I had written; with the first typesetting one, I was able to physically take apart the type after and examine. But with this one, there was no taking it apart immediately; just moving it onto a tray. It made me think of the way printing is often thought of as a labor of love, which made me wonder; if, as shown in Gayomali’s writing, font so drastically changes the way we interact with a text, then why are certain fonts created and used? For example, Comic Sans-- it would stand to reason that, somewhere in the world, there is a printing press that prints, if not occasionally, in Comic Sans, if only because it is such a widespread font. Why? Why would someone go to the labor of printing something in Comic Sans, knowing that their hard work will be seen as a joke at best, and a mockery at worst? Why are fonts that everyone can agree to dislike, still in use? Or fonts such as Wingdings-- in my life, I have never met a person able to read Wingdings, but logically, there exists, somewhere, a job case that contains Wingdings. Why do fonts that are unreadable, and seen as jokes, continue to thrive, as more than jokes, but as actual fonts?
