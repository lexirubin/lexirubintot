I am not great with computers, and especially not with coding. My attention to visual details is not the best, to put it very lightly. I have friends who are computer science majors, and I have very distinct memories of looking at their homework and feeling both stressed out and nauseous just from the way it looked. I actually do really enjoy working with computers; I’m just one of those people who seems to have technical difficulties no matter what I do. So when my code for the lab refused to work, I was extremely disappointed, and extremely unsurprised. I rewrote it several times and even looked at it with a classmate to see if they could spot the problem:

poem <- paste(c("I'll sing you a story of a ", list_word(adjectives), list_word(adjectives)"king, Who", list_word(verbs)," with the ", list_word(nouns), " at the end of a string. But he only loved one single thing. And that was just a", list_word(nouns)), collapse = "")
cat(poem)

But no matter what I did, I kept getting the same result:

Error: unexpected string constant in "poem <- paste(c("I'll sing you a story of a ", list_word(adjectives), list_word(adjectives)"king, Who""
 cat(poem)

And the output was always the same:

I'll sing you a story of amedio from absent my salmonella, and rampaging thy freestyle from pored my don'ts! 
Quoth the Ravbot, 'damnit!'

It is, actually, somewhat bizarre; I have no issue with small details in English grammar, and actually enjoy working with them and understanding how they change our understanding of a written piece. But the second the small details are oriented around codes, my entire understanding seems to go out the window; for the life of me, I cannot figure out what went wrong. Every time I do code something, the “went wrong” is almost always something tiny that should be easy to fix, but a computer’s understanding is so wildly different from a person’s; if I text my sister and cousin “let’s eat kiddos,” neither one of them is going to assume that I am saying we should eat children, because they are able to use logic, and there is immeasurable room for error in the english language. A computer, however, would grow deeply concerned about cannibalistic tendencies that I may or may not be housing.

Just because I might not be the best with working computers, that is not to say that I do not love them, because I have, and from a fairly young age-- I remember sitting around with friends at recess chatting with Cleverbot in middle school, and thinking how incredible it was that this bot could hold a conversation. Though Cleverbot is very different from the bots we looked at in class, the concept of a computer being able to form “thoughts” regardless of how coherent is still incredible. In so many ways, computers are so much more advanced than we are; they are capable of math that leaves many people (myself very much included) slack-jawed. But in others, like grammar, computers may not ever be able to reach a truly human level, and if they did, what would be the consequences? Would we live in a sci-fi robot dystopia, or *The Jetsons*?
