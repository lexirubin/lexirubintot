Somehow, it still shocks me that poetry was so incredibly popular in the 19th century, especially given that it now is a greatly under-appreciated art form. The fact that it was published in newspapers that everyone would read, as opposed to the way people really have to actively seek out poetry now. The fact that "The Children" was, in many ways, so anonymous, is in direct opposition with the way poetry is published now, because poets now have to do so much to get their work read by the public; social media robs the chance for anonymity, and is also the best way for poets to get their work exposed to the public. What brought about this shift? Other than the change in popularity, the only major change is the way people communicate in general; even for non-poetry writing, anonymity is hard to come by. The only modern books I can think of where the author is as anonymous as Dickinson are *The Name of this Book is Secret* by Pseudonymous Botsch, a character, and *A Series of Unfortunate Events* by Lemony Snicket, an even more exaggerated character. Will anonymity ever be  a possibility again for writers? Will there be another such shift, and if so, in what direction?
