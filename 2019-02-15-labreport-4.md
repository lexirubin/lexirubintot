I had never thought much about the materiality of print before actually interacting with a printing press. When I first read Gleickâ€™s *The Information*, I was absolutely baffled by the fact that words would often be spelled in several different ways in the same pamphlet or piece of print. After having worked with a physical press, it makes more sense; though logically I knew you could run out of letters, I had not thought about it as an actual possibility until I was faced with an actual finite number of each letter. I could understand changing up the spelling depending on which letters you had more or less of. Getting to see and hold the form also gave me a new appreciation for how difficult working at a printing press would have been; sure, setting the type is time consuming, but it takes time in a very zen type of way. But holding that form for even a second was difficult, partly because of its size, but also because it was awkward to hold. It was, in many ways, somewhat ironically reminiscent of art depicting stone tablets, especially because, as Borsuk mentions in *The Book*, that which is largely considered to be the first book printed using movable type was, in fact, a Bible. It begs the question: just how intertwined is contemporary print with Western religion? Of course, original manuscripts were often religious, and presses were first, apparently, used to print Bibles; has this aspect of media faded? Or has it simply been surpassed by the newly generalized accessibility of printing? Before, if print was widely controlled by religious circles, there is little reason to believe that there are any fewer modern religious printings; they just make up a lesser percentage of the overall work being created and produced. In hundreds of years, when future scholars look back at the 21st century, what kind of content will we be remembered for? Religion, just like our predecessors? Or something else, like memes, or fantasy, or some other kind of literature? Will books, now that they are so easily printed and widely distributed, be more or less telling about what we as a society are? Is it possible that certain aspects of early society have been lost entirely because of the lack of written record?
