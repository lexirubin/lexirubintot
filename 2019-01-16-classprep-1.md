The page has been evolving for as long as we have been recording things in writing, and Mak does a very fine job of detailing the history of the page. However, she does not spend any extended amount o ftime discussi ng the page's future, outside of the idea that "intellectual rifts [are] drawn between manuscripts, printed books, and their digital counterparts, with scholars from different disciplines formulating their own methods of analysis." This raises the questions: will the intellectual rift ever be bridged? Why does such a divide exist in the first place? The point of media, in my opinion, is to provide people a way to spread their ideas and grant other people access to those ideas, perhaps as a way for people to come together. Does such a rift not defeat the purpose of media entirely? If people get so hung up on the way information is being given to them, how can it be expected that anyone will care about the information itself?
