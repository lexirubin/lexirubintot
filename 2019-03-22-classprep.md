In my last classprep post, I touched briefly on the way Padua's book helps to close the gap between STEM and humanities fields. To further explore this, it is important to discuss the societal obsession with binaries; this is apparent in the obsession with gender. Babbage and Lovelace work well as a story party because they represent two different sides of the gender binary. In their own ways, they also represent the binary of STEM vs humanitites; Lovelace especially, having a poetic father and a mother pushing her towards STEM. So the obvious difference between STEM fields and humanities or arts fields is both highlighted and negated in *The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*; the use of illustrations to tell the story of such an incredibly breakthrough in technology is almost ironic, but highlights the way the two should not remain so separate. Not dissimilarly, Lovelace is someone who falls well outside of the common prototype of an inventor or a mathematician; she is neither old, nor male, she doesn't have "Einstein hair," she wears a dress, and she makes references to poetry in her creating. Alternatively, Baggage is much more an inventor archetype. Their working together is analogous to the cooperation of visual arts and STEM history used to tell their story in Padua's book.
