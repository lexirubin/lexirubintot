As a child, I was described as a “visual and kinetic learner,” which seemed to be code for “she can’t learn anything if she doesn’t interact with it.” Due at lead in part to this, I was very much drawn to Koehn’s Japanese Tray Landscapes and Borsuk and Bouse’s, Between Page and Screen-- that is, of course, when I realized that the latter was a book to be explored, and not just a forgotten laptop left open on the table. Originally, I failed to notice Between Page and Screen, thinking it was an art assignment that somehow was left behind in the archives, and that the computer beside it, with its camera light, was left by another student, and the unfortunate feeling that someone was watching from the other side of the camera was nothing new or exciting. Rather than mess with what I believed to be someone else’s belongings, I explored the significantly more inviting Japanese Tray Landscapes. Of course, once I realized Between Page and Screen was, in fact, something I was not only supposed to look at; I was supposed to be holding it up and reading it like some kind of mystery to be decoded.
But something that I was especially drawn to, aside from the highly interactive aspect of the book, was the specific design of the QR codes in Between Page and Screen.

To me, it looked like a person sitting down at a desk and reading. When I held it up to the camera, I was intrigued by the fact that it seemed to be a letter. I was less thrilled by the fact that it showed up completely backwards:

I spent the better part of ten minutes in the archives just trying to read the backwards text, before finally giving up and wondering if maybe it was meant to be unreadable as some kind of commentary on the accessibility of books, because it was already so difficult to access the literary contents of the book to begin with, having to hold it up to the camera at just the right angle and distance. while someone seemed to figure out after the fact that it needed to be held upside-down in order to have the text appear properly, I found it far more interesting for it to be almost impossible to read, especially in contrast with Kohen’s Japanese Tray Landscapes, which relied almost entirely on pictures and art. If Between Page and Screen was an attack on the intellectual senses, then Japanese Tray Landscapes was a gentle caress. Though it lacked the fast paced interaction of Between Page and Screen, it more than made up for it with its gorgeous images:/Users/lexi/Desktop/Screen Shot 2019-01-25 at 7.03.56 PM.png

Ironically, the opening from the more calming book was far busier than the opening for the other. There were no words on the opening I chose to look at, and no real story, but it still evoked emotions of awe and calmness.
Audubon’s The Birds of America manages to exist as a kind of perfect medium; it has the exciting digital interactiveness of Between Page and Screen and the classic beauty of Japanese Tray Landscapes. I chose to look at pages 8 and 9, the painting of the Great American Hen and its young. The blank page opposing the image reminded me of the way only one page was used in each opening with a QR code for Between Page and Screen, but both books felt crowded compared to Japanese Tray Landscapes, despite being more open. Between Page and Screen feels like New York City, wonderful, but hectic and overwhelming, much the way we live in a more fast paced world than the one that existed during the creation of Japanese Tray Landscapes, and one that loses attention so quickly. While Japanese Tray Landscapes made me feel calm and Between Page and Screen made me feel almost anxious, The Birds of America evoked almost no emotional reaction from me. The interactiveness, while novel and exciting at first, became a hindrance as I struggled with the “mechanism” to turn the pages, and because I could not hold it in my hand, I was not awestruck. I also struggled to truly admire the image, because of the headache-inducing glare from a laptop, which makes me wonder how the book might be better presented in its original form.
