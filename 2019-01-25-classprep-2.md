"Manuscript" is a word tossed about in writing circles with complete and utter abandon. I wrote a chapbook and refer to it as my manuscript-- "oh, well I'm spending the evening editing my *manuscript*,"-- but seeing the illuminated manuscript in the video completely redefined the idea of a manuscript in my eyes. I had really only ever thought of a manuscript as a work of words that were the art, not a work of art in of itself. I had somehow never thought about the work that went into creating a physical manuscript, especially because they’re so easy to print these days. How did “manuscript” manage to develop such a casual and colloquial meaning? According to dictionary.com, a manuscript is “the original text of an author's work, handwritten or now usually typed, that is submitted to a publisher.” How did it come to lose so much of its original meaning to simply become an unpublished draft? Should the word manuscript as used now be considered a linguistic skeuomorph? Should “manuscript” be reserved for its original meaning, because it is something still used?
