The way the novel chooses to portray civilization is so specific- it's still functional and human, but certain aspects were almost medevial, like the prophet trying to take a young girl as his fourth wife. The blending of the classic elements of humanity in that one scene alone, such as musicians travelling together, blending with something that seems so archaiac. Why make the point that people are still people, and skip over the classic "unraveling of humanity" apocalypse trope? Is it an unwavering faith in humanity, or a belief that maybe people can't change?
