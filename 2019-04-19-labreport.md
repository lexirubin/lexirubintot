Getting to play with the paper circuits was a welcome break from classwork at the end of the semester. It reminded me of the interactive books I used to love in elementary school; *Tear This Book Up*, which encouraged the reader to write in the margins and create their own unique version of the book, and other similar books. Getting to play with the paper circuits in conjunction in conjunction with *What Football Will Look Like in the Future* was especially interesting; both were highly interactive, but completely different. Both seemed impossible; something strange that I noticed about the online article was that the second time you read it, it does not “glitch out” like it does the first time. Bizarrely, I found that incredibly disappointing. For some reason, I felt like it was a key part of the experience, and even though I had experienced it, I worried when sending the link to others that they would not get that beginning part. So far, nobody I have sent it to had actually read it, either because of the football subject matter (which is not super appealing to most of my immediate friend group), or because of time (I tried sending it to my father, a football junkie, and my uncle, a career football agent), so I am unsure as to whether or not it works properly when I send it. Not dissimilar to how I went into every circuit I tried to make, unsure of whether or not it would work. More often than not, the circuit did not work, but the trial and error was exciting, if not disappointing at times. But the feeling when it did work was very satisfying. I can imagine that the programming for 17776 must have been similar; frustrating at first, but incredibly satisfying once it worked. In fact, I can imagine that it must have been like that for all the technology we studied this semester; how much trial and error must have been required to develop the technology I am using to type this very lab report?
