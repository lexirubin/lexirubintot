It is absolutey mind-boggling to me that as far back as 1894, people were panicking about books fading into oblivion-- it seems, often, that the obsoletion of books is a newer fear that has come about because of the latest technology, and speaks to the cyclical nature of humanity's fears. Fears that new technology will rule humanity's minds, as demonstrated in the quote "Either the books must go, or they must swallow us up." Books were the new, scary technology, and that line of thinking is perfectly aligned with the Y2K fear that computers would come to life and take over. Of course that never happened, and of course books did not take over humanity in any way, aside from being widespread. Why is it that luddite people always seem to have the loudest voices? What exactly are they afraid of? Does it speak to a fear of not understanding and being left behind?
