A little fun fact about me: I have terrible handwriting. When possible, I avoid taking handwritten notes and turning in handwritten assignments, because too frequently they turn out illegible. When I was in middle school, my parents actually looked for a handwriting summer camp, and the only reason I did not attend was that it was too late to sign up. So to say I struggled with the lab would be an immense understatement. I am very much an all-or-nothing kind of person, so when transcribing the letter in front of me, I made sure to copy the handwriting, the spacing of the words, everything-- I wanted to produce as near an exact copy as I possibly could. In the time allotted, I was able to get through approximately three sentences of questionable legibility, and had to pause far too frequently because my hand was beginning to cramp. I can safely say that transcribing by hand in candlelight is not a career I can see myself pursuing; I would be more Chaucer’s cursed Adam than anything else. I find myself understanding-- and agreeing with-- Trithemius’ *In Praise Of Scribes* far more after having completed this lab; without the scribes, not only would media have been incredibly hard to come by then, we would have significantly less information about media and life in general from that period of time. And it is very clear that that was, at least in part, a reason for scribes to take things down; Trithemius says that “the scribe commending letters to parchment extends his own and the letters' lifespan for ages,” a subtle irony as his own works were, more likely than not, written on parchment, for them to have lasted as long as they have, and thus he ensured that he would be around on the page centuries after his death.

As I stated earlier, my handwriting is “chicken-scratch” at best. Still, I have and always will love writing-- the creation of media ideas, not the physical act of writing--, and as such, I am infinitely grateful for the invention of the laptop, and of course for smartphones (to jot down poorly-timed ideas). Of course, both of these are rendered useless without a charging cord. While some people like to claim that phones and computers divide us, I think, in some ways, they can bring people together; for instance, the moment someone asks if anyone has a charger, the immediate response throughout the room is to ask what kind of charger and then for everyone to check their bags or pockets. I have never used a charger to write something down, and, without much thought, its relationship to media seemed sketchy at best; but while a charger might not provide media, it makes access possible. To think about a cord as a means of media seems far more obvious with an HDMI cord that transfers information from one source to another, but a charging cord transfers no information; simply electricity. But without that electricity, accessing any type of digital media would be completely impossible, much the way candles, though seemingly unrelated to writing, made media possible.
