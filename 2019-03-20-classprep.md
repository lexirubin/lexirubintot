To say that women are underrepresented in STEM fields would be, perhaps, one of the greatest understatements a person could possibly share. Historically, it has been a male-dominated field, and those few women that have been able to break into it are rarely taken seriously, or their achievements are written off and then attributed to men. Only in the last decade or so, with the new push to get women and young girls active in STEM, have the achievements of several incredible women in the field become common knowledge, and one of the women who is finally beginning to get the recognition she deserves is Ada Lovelace. Her story with Charles Babbage told in the form of a graphic novel likens her to a superhero of some sort, even in the name of the book itself. The illustrations do wonders to visualize a relationship between art and math, and frequently Ada muses over the application of "poetic thoughts" to improve her mathematical work, further closing the gap between STEM and other fields.
