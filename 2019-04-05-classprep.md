Jon Bois's "What Football Will Look Like in the Future" is one of my favorite pieces, full stop. The first time I read it, I was dreading it because I am not the world's biggest football fan, not by any stretch of the imagination, so I was incredibly relieved to see that it was not really about football. Though I was not surprised by the piece the second time reading it, I still enjoyed it, and found myself thinking of the Mars Opportunity Rover that was declared "dead" in February; in a way, Nine and Ten reminded me of Opportunity and Curiousity, respectively. I also found myself paying more attention to the medium the second time around. The visual aspect of the calendars is what most stood out to me; it emphasized so heavily the time passing without saying "time passed." I found the change in fonts to be fascinating; how was it decided what font would be associated with which time?
