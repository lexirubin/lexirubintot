I never knew that the Latin root for invention meant "to find." I had always assumed it came from something closer to "to create," because I have always thought of inventions as being, well, creations, rather than someone finding something. So the fact that the task was to find an argument, rather than to create one, seemed almost bizarre to me; why would you simply find an existing argument, when you could create a new one? I also found myself wondering about the various ways for a student to read from the book; how common was it for a student to mark up the text they were using? If books were so rare and valuable, why would they be marked up so frequently? How frequently are commonplace books now, and how often are they used now in an academic setting? Are they perhaps seen as a less helpful resource than the original manuscripts, or more helpful because of the additional notes from the students?
