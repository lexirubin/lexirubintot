Before this class, I had not thought much about the internal layout of a book as being especially important. I tended to think of font as a means to an end, more than anything else. Why has the use of font to relay a message fallen out of common practive, especially now that intricate fonts are so much easier and cheaper than they would have been then? Is it simply because, in many cases, creating a physical book has become less a labor of love, and more a means of profit? Is that shift reflective of just western culture, or of humanity as a whole? Or perhaps just the way attitudes toward reading have shifted? I had also never thought about how much more difficult it would have been for less affluent members of a community to access books, especially because you can get a paperback at the Goodwill for under $5, and because books carry less material value, it's far less nerve wrecking to lend a book to a friend or even a casual acquaintance, and even a way of becoming closer with a person.
