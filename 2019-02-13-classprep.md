I find it very interesting how originally "printer" referred to a person, but, as pointed out, it now refers to a machine. However, did it not originally also refer to the machine on which a printer was printing? I also have to wonder; how prone is print culture to the elitism that so frequently plagues literary circles? Obviously, I am by no means an expert in printing, but it would stand to reason that being a printer is not feasible for many people, and given the time it took for Huskiana Press to come into being, I can assume it is more than a little time consuming. Though Hayles and Pressman to touch lightly on the topic of elitism, there is offered no solution to the problem; merely an admission that it exists and a slight rap on the knuckles, saying it is not good. Why are people in literary circles often so quick to call out issues that cause a divide-- things that isolate people of color, women, LGBT+ people, etc-- but then just as quick to abandon the issue, as though it is a problem for someone else to deal with? If the people who have the power to fix it ignore the problem, it cannot improve; it will only be more and more steadily ignored while simultaneously being acknowledged just enough for those in charge to pat themselves on the back.
