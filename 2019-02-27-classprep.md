Anna North's article "When Novels Were Bad For You" brings light to an issue of internet reading being viewed as lesser than novel reading. The fact of the matter is, no matter what the younger generation is doing, older generations are going to look upon it with disdain; the Boomers look down on Gen X, who look down on the Millenials, who look down on Gen Z. It's part of the cyclical nature of life. What I found especially interesting was the way Frank Furedi's article mentioned the "reading addiction" which seems incredibly similar to today's "videogame addiction." Now society views excessive reading as the mark of an intelligent person, while excessive videogaming is viewed as being for lazy asocial people. Is it possible that a hundred years down the line videogaming will be seen as an intelligent hobby, something that people study and respect? What will mark the change; will it be when videogames become more easily accessible, especially financially? Will videogames become a part of education, as integral as books? When I was in elementary school, books were the key components, and near the end of my elementary school years, videogames of the very aggressively academic variety (such as Type To Learn) were used sparingly and supplementally. Is it possible that in fifty or so years, videogames will be the key components?
