The inclusion of the King Lear beginning is incredibly specific, especially because it isn't something especially common in productions of the show. It paves the way for the scene with Jeevan and Kirsten. There's an irony to an actor playing the mad king having a sudden health issue and falling prey to a madness of his own kind. I also found it very interesting to be hearing about the flu epidemic through Jeevan's eyes, because he is a character we know is prone to melodrama and panic, so it forces the reader to take what they hear about the epidemic, especially at the beginning, with a grain of salt, since it seems to be almost impossible for any virus to be spreading as quickly as the flu is spreading. Why the decision to make it ambiguous in its severity by having the message being sent through Jeevan?
