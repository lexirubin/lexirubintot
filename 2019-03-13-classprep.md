So frequently, there is a strict line drawn between humanities and the sciences. One of the most stand out parts of the readings for today, in my opinion, was the fact that the two are intrinsically linked and inseparable from one another. The telegraph and telephone were both incredible technological strides, but they were also both used solely for communication, which is typically seen as falling under the umbrella of humanities, hence the age old joke that scientists cannot write. However, most fascinating, in my opinion, was the way they applied physics and used Einstein's work when trying to measure the noises that they were seeing; the use of a hard science to solve a humanities issue. When did science and humanities become so split? Was there always this divide? Why are people so determined that the divide must exist; why can STEM and humanities so infrequently be used to support understanding of the other?
